# Commutr V2
A recreation of Austin Webre's Commutr app in F# using MVU. You can find the existing app in the Apple App Store. (It is cross platform but exists currently only on iOS.)

This project started as a part of a blog post exploring F# and MVU, which can be found at [https://usecasepod.github.io/posts/mvu-with-xamarin.html](https://usecasepod.github.io/posts/mvu-with-xamarin.html).
